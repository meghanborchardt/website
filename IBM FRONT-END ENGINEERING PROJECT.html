        <h2>MEGHAN </h2>
        <H2>Front-End Engineer and UX/UI Developer at Arizona State University</H2>
        <p>I earned a degree in Technical Communication and a minor in Project
            Management from Arizona State University, where I gained a broad
            skill set, including technical writing, coding, software development,
            and UI/UX design. I also earned multiple software certifications
            through ASU, reinforcing my technical foundation.
            
            
            
            As a versatile engineer, I bring both technical expertise and creative
            vision to every project. This portfolio highlights the design aspects of
            my work, reflecting my focus on both development and user
            experience."</p>
            <p>PLEASE NOTE: This is a sample web page created for one of my university courses. I put it together in 5 mins if its bad thats why. This is not an accurate representation of my abilities.</p>
